              Do you really know the lyrics of your favorite songs? We really
              don't think so but please, prove us wrong!

              Start by creating a game where you add your favorite songs to the
              playlist (or new ones if you are daring). When you're done with
              your playlist name it to something special! Either you are playing
              your own games or other players' created games.
              <br />
              <br />
              The game is to sort out the randomized sentences to the actual
              lyrics. The more accurate lyrics, the more points you get. And
              also, think fast! If you know the words and are fast enough, you
              will get higher points. Lets beat the highscores of every
              playlists! &#128540;&#128526; &#129327;
